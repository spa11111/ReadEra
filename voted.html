                <p>THERE WERE WORSE THINGS THAN BEING STRANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF nowhere during a rainstorm.</p>
                <p>For example, I could be running from a rabid bear intent on mauling me into the next century.</p>
                <p>Or I could be tied to a chair in a dark basement and forced to listen to Aqua’s “Barbie Girl” on repeat until I’d rather gnaw off my arm than hear the song’s eponymous phrase again.</p>
                <p>But just because things could be worse didn’t mean they didn’t suck.</p>
                <p>Stop. Think positive thoughts.</p>
                <p>“An Uber will show up…now.” I stared at my phone, biting back my frustration when the app reassured me it was “finding my ride”, the way it had been for the past half hour.</p>
                <p>Normally, I’d be less stressed about the situation because hey, at least I had a working phone and a bus shelter to keep me mostly dry from the pounding rain. But Josh’s farewell party was starting in an hour, I had yet to pick up his surprise cake from the bakery, and it would be dark soon. I may be a glass half full kinda gal, but I wasn’t an idiot.</p>
                <p>No one—especially not a college girl with zero fighting skills to speak of—wants to find herself alone in the middle of nowhere after dark. I should’ve taken those self-defense classes with Jules like she wanted. I mentally scrolled through my limited options.</p>
                <p>The bus that stopped at this location didn’t run on the weekends, and most of my friends didn’t own a car. Bridget had car service, but she was at an embassy event until seven. Uber wasn’t working, and I hadn’t seen a single car pass by since the rain started. Not that I would hitchhike, anyway—I’ve watched horror movies, thank you very much.
